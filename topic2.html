          <h1 class="subhone"><center>What is Ethics?<center></h1>
          <p class="partle">In a nutshell, ethics is the moral compass that directs an individual's decisions and actions throughout their lifetime. What is deemed to be right and bad for a community or society at large is included in the concept of a moral code, which transcends the boundaries of an individual.</p>
          <p class="partle">Ethics is the study of moral decision-making, rights, obligations, language use, and what it means to live an ethical life. While moralizing may seem like an academic pursuit, it's more often an attempt to rationalize our emotions and gut feelings. Since morality is a subjective concept, many people have strong, unwavering beliefs about what is right and wrong, which can put them in stark opposition to other people's moral convictions. Morality may differ from person to person, religion to religion, and culture to culture, however many morality have been proven to be universal, originating from fundamental human feelings.</p>
          <p class="partle"><i>Note:</i> Moral means conforming to the established ideas of right or wrong.</p>

        <p class="partle">A person's personal ethics are the moral precepts they apply to their decision-making and behavior in both personal and professional contexts. These principles have an impact on many facets of a person's life and aid in the development of their work ethic, values, and aspirations in both their personal and professional lives. People apply their ethics to distinguish between good and wrong and to shape other people's actions under difficult circumstances. Although everyone has a different code of ethics, many people have similar values like respect and honesty.
